## Rubric Points
### Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/432/view) individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

---
### Files Submitted & Code Quality

#### 1. Submission includes all required files and can be used to run the simulator in autonomous mode

My project includes the following files:
* model.py containing the script to create and train the model
* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode
* model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network 
* writeup_report.md or writeup_report.pdf summarizing the results

#### 2. Submission includes functional code
Using the Udacity provided simulator and my drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing 
```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

#### 3. Submission code is usable and readable

The model.py file contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. The file shows the pipeline I used for training and validating the model, and it contains comments to explain how the code works.

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed

My model consists of a convolution neural network with 3x3 filter sizes and depths between 16 and 64. 
The model includes RELU layers to introduce nonlinearity (code line 66,68,70), and the data is normalized in the model using a Keras lambda layer (code line 65). 

TO reduce model complexity and reduce learning time, I added two maxpool layers.

#### 2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model

The model contains two dropout layers in order to reduce overfitting (model.py lines 74, 76). 

The model was trained and validated on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting (code line 19). The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.

#### 3. Model parameter tuning

The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (model.py line 80).

#### 4. Appropriate training data

I used udacity data set to train the model.In order to make full use of the data, I not only used the middle camera photos, but also used the photos of the left and right cameras. When using the photos of the left and right cameras to train the steering angle, I will give a certain correction factor to it.

In order to further increase the amount of data, I used a flip. In this way, not only the amount of training data is doubled, but the training data also contains information in the opposite direction.

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. Solution Design Approach

My first step was to use 3 layer 3x3 convolutional layer and 4 fuuly connected layer. I think this model simple and efficient, but when run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one, It performs very poorly, only a few steps he vehicle fell off the track.

From the first experience, I think the model is too simple. So I add one more convolutional layer. This time the vichle performance has improved a lot, but at the big corner the vehicle fell off the track.

Then I try the nvida model, I thought this model might be appropriate because this model is used for training real car.
I found that this model had a low mean squared error on the training set but a high mean squared error on the validation set. This implied that the model was overfitting. 

Then I add two dropout layers affter fully connected layer, this may  handle the overfitting well.

At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.

#### 2. Final Model Architecture

The final model architecture consisted of a convolution neural network with the following layers and layer sizes 

Here is a visualization of the architecture (note: visualizing the architecture is optional according to the project rubric)

* Image cropping
* Image normalization
* Convolution: 5x5, filter: 24, strides: 2x2, activation: ELU
* Convolution: 5x5, filter: 36, strides: 2x2, activation: ELU
* Convolution: 5x5, filter: 48, strides: 2x2, activation: ELU
* Convolution: 3x3, filter: 64, strides: 1x1, activation: ELU
* Convolution: 3x3, filter: 64, strides: 1x1, activation: ELU
* Fully connected: neurons: 100, activation: ELU
* Drop out (0.5)
* Fully connected: neurons: 50, activation: ELU
* Drop out (0.5)
* Fully connected: neurons: 10, activation: ELU
* Fully connected: neurons: 1 (output)

#### 3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process

Due to the serious delay of the simulator, it is difficult for me to drive a car to collect data. So I used the data set provided by Udacity.
To augment the data sat, I flipped images ,this could double the data set. For example, here is an image that has then been flipped:

![Normal Image][image1]
![Flipped Image][image2]

To make most use of the data set, I not only use the center images but also the left and right imags. In order to be able to use the left and right images, correction factors need to add.

After the above process, I had 48216 number of data points. I finally randomly shuffled the data set and put 10% of the data into a validation set. 

Before train
* Image cropping, cut off the top and buttom unnecessary pixel, avoid confuse the model.
* Image normalization

As for train
* I used mean squared error for the loss function to measure how close the model predicts to the given steering angle for each image.
* I used Adam optimizer for optimization.

# Behavioral Cloning Project——the origin readme

[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
This repository contains starting files for the Behavioral Cloning Project.

In this project, you will use what you've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior. You will train, validate and test a model using Keras. The model will output a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.

We have provided a simulator where you can steer a car around a track for data collection. You'll use image data and steering angles to train a neural network and then use this model to drive the car autonomously around the track.

We also want you to create a detailed writeup of the project. Check out the [writeup template](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3/blob/master/writeup_template.md) for this project and use it as a starting point for creating your own writeup. The writeup can be either a markdown file or a pdf document.

To meet specifications, the project will require submitting five files: 
* model.py (script used to create and train the model)
* drive.py (script to drive the car - feel free to modify this file)
* model.h5 (a trained Keras model)
* a report writeup file (either markdown or pdf)
* video.mp4 (a video recording of your vehicle driving autonomously around the track for at least one full lap)

This README file describes how to output the video in the "Details About Files In This Directory" section.

Creating a Great Writeup
---
A great writeup should include the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/432/view) as well as your description of how you addressed each point.  You should include a detailed description of the code used (with line-number references and code snippets where necessary), and links to other supporting documents or external references.  You should include images in your writeup to demonstrate how your code works with examples.  

All that said, please be concise!  We're not looking for you to write a book here, just a brief description of how you passed each rubric point, and references to the relevant code :). 

You're not required to use markdown for your writeup.  If you use another method please just submit a pdf of your writeup.

The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior 
* Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
* Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator. The vehicle should remain on the road for an entire loop around the track.
* Summarize the results with a written report

### Dependencies
This lab requires:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

The lab enviroment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.

The following resources can be found in this github repository:
* drive.py
* video.py
* writeup_template.md

The simulator can be downloaded from the classroom. In the classroom, we have also provided sample data that you can optionally use to help train your model.

## Details About Files In This Directory

### `drive.py`

Usage of `drive.py` requires you have saved the trained model as an h5 file, i.e. `model.h5`. See the [Keras documentation](https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-save-a-keras-model) for how to create this file using the following command:
```sh
model.save(filepath)
```

Once the model has been saved, it can be used with drive.py using this command:

```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

The above command will load the trained model and use the model to make predictions on individual images in real-time and send the predicted angle back to the server via a websocket connection.

Note: There is known local system's setting issue with replacing "," with "." when using drive.py. When this happens it can make predicted steering values clipped to max/min values. If this occurs, a known fix for this is to add "export LANG=en_US.utf8" to the bashrc file.

#### Saving a video of the autonomous agent

```sh
python drive.py model.h5 run1
```

The fourth argument, `run1`, is the directory in which to save the images seen by the agent. If the directory already exists, it'll be overwritten.

```sh
ls run1

...
```

The image file name is a timestamp of when the image was seen. This information is used by `video.py` to create a chronological video of the agent driving.

### `video.py`

```sh
python video.py run1
```

Creates a video based on images found in the `run1` directory. The name of the video will be the name of the directory followed by `'.mp4'`, so, in this case the video will be `run1.mp4`.

Optionally, one can specify the FPS (frames per second) of the video:

```sh
python video.py run1 --fps 48
```

Will run the video at 48 FPS. The default FPS is 60.

#### Why create a video

1. It's been noted the simulator might perform differently based on the hardware. So if your model drives succesfully on your machine it might not on another machine (your reviewer). Saving a video is a solid backup in case this happens.
2. You could slightly alter the code in `drive.py` and/or `video.py` to create a video of what your model sees after the image is processed (may be helpful for debugging).

### Tips
- Please keep in mind that training images are loaded in BGR colorspace using cv2 while drive.py load images in RGB to predict the steering angles.
